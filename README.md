# Resilient Email-Sending Service

This project is a resilient email-sending service implemented in JavaScript. It uses two mock email providers to simulate email delivery and includes several robust features to handle failures and ensure reliable email delivery.

## Key Features

- **Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff**: Automatically retries sending emails after a failure with increasing delay intervals.
- **Provider Fallback**: Switches to a secondary email provider if the primary one fails to send an email.
- **Idempotency**: Ensures the same email is not sent multiple times.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of emails that can be sent within a specific timeframe to avoid overloading the system.
- **Status Tracking**: Logs the status of each email sent (e.g., success, failure, queued).
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Temporarily stops sending emails after repeated failures to avoid overwhelming the system.
- **Simple Logging**: Outputs logs to the console for monitoring and debugging.
- **Basic Queue System**: Queues emails that are rate-limited and processes them when allowed.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Create a Project Directory**:

   Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for the project:

   ```bash
   mkdir email-sending-service
   cd email-sending-service
   ```

2. **Create the JavaScript File**:

   Create a new file named `emailService.js` in the project directory. You can do this in several ways:

   - **Windows**:
     - Open the directory in File Explorer.
     - Right-click, select **New > Text Document**, and rename it to `emailService.js` (make sure to change the file extension from `.txt` to `.js`).
   
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     - In your terminal, run:
       ```bash
       touch emailService.js
       ```

3. **Copy the Code**:

   Copy the complete JavaScript code provided for the `EmailService` class and paste it into `emailService.js`.

4. **Run the Service**:

   In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory (`email-sending-service`) and run:

   ```bash
   node emailService.js
   ```

5. **View the Output**:

   Check the terminal for the output logs, which will display the status of each email sending attempt, including successes, failures, and any retries or circuit breaker activations.

### Assumptions

- **Mock Providers**: This service uses mock email providers for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, these would be replaced with real email provider APIs (e.g., SendGrid, Amazon SES).
- **Failure Simulation**: The mock providers have a 30% failure rate to simulate real-world conditions and test the retry and fallback mechanisms.
- **Rate Limiting**: The service is set to send a maximum of 5 emails per minute to prevent overloading. This can be adjusted as needed.
- **Idempotency**: The service tracks sent email IDs to avoid duplicate sends. This is crucial for ensuring emails are not sent multiple times unintentionally.
- **Circuit Breaker**: If the service encounters three consecutive failures, it will open the circuit for 10 seconds before attempting to send emails again.
- **Logging**: Logs are printed to the console for simplicity. In a production setup, a logging library (like Winston or Bunyan) should be used to manage and store logs.

### Example Usage

Below is an example of how to use the `EmailService` class in your project:

```javascript
// Example usage of EmailService
(async () => {
  const emailService = new EmailService([provider1, provider2]);

  const email1 = { id: "1", to: "user1@example.com", subject: "Hello", body: "Hello User1" };
  const email2 = { id: "2", to: "user2@example.com", subject: "Hello", body: "Hello User2" };

  await emailService.send(email1);
  await emailService.send(email2);

  console.log(emailService.statusTracker);

  // Process any emails that are in the queue due to rate limiting
  emailService.processQueue();
})();
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Node.js Not Installed**: If the command `node -v` does not return a version number, ensure that Node.js is installed correctly.
- **Syntax Errors**: Ensure all JavaScript code is copied correctly without missing brackets or commas.
- **Permission Issues**: On Linux or macOS, if you encounter permission errors, try using `sudo` to run commands with elevated permissions.

### Future Enhancements

- Integrate with real email providers like SendGrid or Amazon SES.
- Implement a more advanced queue management system using a dedicated job queue library.
- Enhance logging with a comprehensive logging framework.
- Improve rate limiting with more sophisticated algorithms or distributed rate limiting.
